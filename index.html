    <em><h3>Who are we?</h3></em>
    <p>We are Flogramming, an organisation aiming to tackle issues surrounding the ethics of Computer Science. Our goal is to have ended these issues by the year 2030 however, with the progression of technology these are becoming increasingly more difficult to address. We wish to raise awareness about the societal issues caused by technology and in doing so influence people to make a difference to help overcome these problems</p>
