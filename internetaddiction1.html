            <em><h2>What is internet addiction?</h2></em>
        </div>
    </div>
            <p>Internet addiction is characterized by excessive or poorly controlled preoccupations, urges or behaviours regarding computer use and internet access that lead to impairment or distress. The condition has attracted increasing attention in the popular media and among researchers, and this attention has paralleled the growth in computer (and Internet) access. The disorder occurs worldwide, but mainly in countries where computer access and technology are widespread. Clinical samples and a majority of relevant surveys report a male preponderance. Onset is reported to occur in the late 20s or early 30s age group, and there is often a lag of a decade or more from initial to problematic computer usage. Internet addiction has been associated with dimensionally measured depression and indicators of social isolation. </p>

            <h3>What can we do to help?</h3>
            <p>As consumers, we should be conscious of what we buy, and try to buy products with long term guarantee. This is unfortunately very difficult as the tech industry is dominated by oligopolies such as Apple and Samsung, but we should try not to buy new devices when we don't need them. If it is necessary to update a device, be mindful in the way you dispose of it, rather than discard the device where it will end up in landfill. Instead, give the device to companies that will reuse the components.</p>
